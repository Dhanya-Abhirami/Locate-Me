# Space Station :rocket: :earth_asia: (GDG VIT Task)
Locating International Space Station (ISS) and Astronauts real time
<br>
### What this project does? <br>
* Finding the names of astronauts currently at the ISS
* Finding the current location of ISS above the earth
* Plotting the location on the map
### What is ISS ?
* The International Space Station (ISS) is a space station, or a habitable artificial satellite, in low Earth orbit.
* It is a multi-nation construction project that is the largest single structure humans ever put into space. 
* The ISS is moving at close to 28,000 km/h so its location changes really fast. 
### Open Notify API
* In order to determine the position of the ISS, API’s are used.
* Open Notify is an open source project to provide a simple programming interface for some of NASA’s data. 
* The data is scraped and turned into APIs related to space and spacecraft.
